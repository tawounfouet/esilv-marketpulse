# TD07 - Data Normalization + Comparison

## Duration

```text
1 hour 30 minutes
```

## Business requirement

```text
"All market-data sources must feed a common comparison model."
```

## Context

The collaborative Git workflow is now established.

TD07 introduces the first reusable analytics layer in MarketPulse.

The problem is simple:

```text
AAPL price
about 250 USD

S&P 500 level
about 6600 points
```

Raw levels are on different scales.

To answer:

> Is the selected instrument outperforming or underperforming its benchmark over the same period?

MarketPulse needs:

```text
canonical numeric rows
+
common dates
+
period return
+
base 100
+
relative performance
```

The comparison logic must also be reusable by later providers.

That is why TD07 introduces:

```text
src/analytics.py
```

## Learning objectives

At the end of TD07, you should be able to:

- distinguish local CSV acquisition from reusable analytics;
- convert CSV numeric fields to useful Python types;
- preserve the canonical MarketPulse row structure;
- align instrument and benchmark observations by common date;
- calculate a period return;
- calculate a base-100 series;
- calculate relative performance;
- use percentage points correctly;
- place provider-neutral comparison logic in `src/analytics.py`;
- reuse the established Git workflow without relearning it.

## CORE definition of done

TD07 is complete when the team can confirm:

```text
[ ] src/analytics.py exists
[ ] analytics.py contains no provider-specific identifier
[ ] CSV close values are numeric before analytics
[ ] instrument and benchmark are aligned on common dates
[ ] calculate_period_return() works
[ ] calculate_base_100() starts at 100
[ ] calculate_relative_performance() uses instrument minus benchmark
[ ] src/main.py reuses analytics.py
[ ] python src/main.py works
[ ] no return percentage is hard-coded
[ ] the TD07 change follows the established branch / PR workflow
```

Daily returns are OPTIONAL.

They are not required to complete TD07 or the final CORE dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Before starting:

```text
[ ] TD01-TD06 completed
[ ] team main is synchronized
[ ] python src/main.py works
[ ] instrument and benchmark are loaded
[ ] branch / PR / review workflow is understood
```

Update local main:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git status
python src/main.py
```

Start from a clean working tree.

## Session plan

The CORE is designed for approximately 80 minutes.

The final 10 minutes are reserved for review, troubleshooting and optional analytics.

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 00-08 min | Comparison problem and canonical rows |
| 08-20 min | Normalize local CSV numeric fields |
| 20-35 min | Create analytics.py and align common dates |
| 35-48 min | Period return + relative performance |
| 48-62 min | Base-100 series |
| 62-72 min | Integrate analytics into main.py |
| 72-80 min | Validate + standard Git handoff |
| 80-90 min | Buffer / review / OPTIONAL |

## Repository evolution

TD07 changes the CORE structure from:

```text
src/
└── main.py
```

to:

```text
src/
├── main.py
└── analytics.py
```

Responsibility split:

```text
src/main.py
=
local CSV orchestration
+
terminal output

src/analytics.py
=
provider-neutral comparison logic
```

The analytics module must not contain identifiers such as:

```text
AAPL
SP500
^GSPC
AAPL US Equity
SPX Index
```

Those belong outside reusable analytics.

# CORE

# Part 1 - Understand the comparison problem

Raw price levels answer:

```text
"What is the value?"
```

Performance answers:

```text
"How much did the value change?"
```

The comparison contract is:

```text
same lookback
+
same interval
+
common observation dates
```

For the common course path:

```text
Lookback : 1 month
Interval : Daily
```

Do not compare different periods or different frequencies.

# Part 2 - Create the TD07 feature branch

Use the workflow learned in TD05 and TD06.

Start from current team `main`:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git status
```

Create:

```bash
git switch -c feature/market-comparison
```

TD07 does not reteach Git theory.

Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` when you need the standard workflow reminder.

# Part 3 - Normalize local CSV rows

The CSV reader returns text.

A raw row is conceptually:

```python
{
    "date": "2026-09-01",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "open": "249.20",
    "high": "251.50",
    "low": "248.00",
    "close": "250.00",
    "volume": "38000000",
}
```

The canonical MarketPulse row fields remain:

```text
date
ticker
open
high
low
close
volume
```

For analytics, numeric fields must be numeric.

A simple local CSV normalization helper may be kept in `src/main.py`:

```python
def normalize_price_row(row):
    return {
        "date": row["date"],
        "ticker": row["ticker"],
        "open": float(row["open"]),
        "high": float(row["high"]),
        "low": float(row["low"]),
        "close": float(row["close"]),
        "volume": int(row["volume"]),
    }
```

Then:

```python
normalized_prices = [
    normalize_price_row(row)
    for row in prices
]
```

Why keep this outside `analytics.py`?

Because `analytics.py` should receive comparison-ready canonical rows.

Later providers will be responsible for producing that same row shape.

## Validate types

Temporarily inspect:

```python
print(type(normalized_prices[0]["close"]))
print(type(normalized_prices[0]["volume"]))
```

Expected:

```text
float
int
```

Remove temporary debug output afterward.

# Part 4 - Create src/analytics.py

Create:

```text
src/analytics.py
```

TD07 CORE introduces these reusable functions:

```python
index_by_date(...)
align_series(...)
calculate_period_return(...)
calculate_base_100(...)
calculate_relative_performance(...)
```

Keep each function small.

# Part 5 - Index rows by date

In `src/analytics.py`:

```python
def index_by_date(prices):
    return {
        row["date"]: row
        for row in prices
    }
```

This converts:

```text
list of rows
```

into:

```text
date
  |
  v
row
```

for simple alignment.

# Part 6 - Align instrument and benchmark

Implement:

```python
def align_series(instrument_prices, benchmark_prices):
    instrument_by_date = index_by_date(instrument_prices)
    benchmark_by_date = index_by_date(benchmark_prices)

    common_dates = sorted(
        set(instrument_by_date)
        & set(benchmark_by_date)
    )

    aligned_instrument = [
        instrument_by_date[date]
        for date in common_dates
    ]

    aligned_benchmark = [
        benchmark_by_date[date]
        for date in common_dates
    ]

    return aligned_instrument, aligned_benchmark
```

Use it after filtering:

```python
aligned_instrument, aligned_benchmark = align_series(
    instrument_prices,
    benchmark_prices,
)
```

With the starter sample, both aligned series should contain:

```text
21 observations
```

with:

```text
first common date : 2026-09-01
last common date  : 2026-09-30
```

The important invariant is:

```text
len(aligned_instrument)
=
len(aligned_benchmark)
```

and corresponding rows refer to the same dates.

# Part 7 - Calculate period return

Use the aligned rows.

Formula:

```text
(last close / first close - 1) * 100
```

Implement in `src/analytics.py`:

```python
def calculate_period_return(prices):
    first_close = prices[0]["close"]
    last_close = prices[-1]["close"]

    return (last_close / first_close - 1) * 100
```

Then:

```python
instrument_return = calculate_period_return(
    aligned_instrument
)

benchmark_return = calculate_period_return(
    aligned_benchmark
)
```

Interpretation:

```text
positive
=
ending close above starting close

negative
=
ending close below starting close
```

# Part 8 - Calculate relative performance

Relative performance is:

```text
instrument period return
-
benchmark period return
```

Implement:

```python
def calculate_relative_performance(
    instrument_return,
    benchmark_return,
):
    return instrument_return - benchmark_return
```

Example:

```text
Instrument return : +6.48%
Benchmark return  : +2.15%

Relative performance
=
+4.33 percentage points
```

Use:

```text
percentage points
```

for this simple difference between percentage returns.

Do not reverse the subtraction.

# Part 9 - Build base 100

Base 100 puts differently scaled series on a common starting point.

Formula:

```text
current close / first close * 100
```

Implement:

```python
def calculate_base_100(prices):
    first_close = prices[0]["close"]
    result = []

    for row in prices:
        result.append({
            "date": row["date"],
            "ticker": row["ticker"],
            "value": row["close"] / first_close * 100,
        })

    return result
```

For both series:

```text
first base-100 value
=
100.00
```

The last value should be consistent with the period return.

Conceptually:

```text
period return = +6.48%

final base 100
about
106.48
```

Do not overwrite the original close values.

# Part 10 - Integrate analytics into main.py

Import the reusable functions:

```python
from analytics import (
    align_series,
    calculate_base_100,
    calculate_period_return,
    calculate_relative_performance,
)
```

Keep the flow understandable:

```text
load local CSV / JSON
        |
        v
normalize CSV rows
        |
        v
filter instrument + benchmark
        |
        v
align_series()
        |
        v
calculate_period_return()
calculate_base_100()
calculate_relative_performance()
        |
        v
display terminal summary
```

Target output shape:

```text
=== MarketPulse ===

Market configuration
Period   : 1 month
Interval : Daily

Instrument
AAPL - Apple Inc.
Period return : 6.48%

Benchmark
SP500 - S&P 500
Period return : 2.15%

Relative performance
AAPL vs SP500 : +4.33 percentage points

Base 100
AAPL  : 100.00 -> 106.48
SP500 : 100.00 -> 102.15
```

Use calculated values.

Do not hard-code percentages.

# Part 11 - CORE validation

Run:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Then verify:

```text
[ ] aligned series are not empty
[ ] aligned series have the same number of rows
[ ] corresponding rows use common dates
[ ] close values are numeric
[ ] period returns are calculated from aligned rows
[ ] relative performance = instrument - benchmark
[ ] first instrument base-100 value = 100
[ ] first benchmark base-100 value = 100
[ ] analytics.py contains no provider-specific identifier
[ ] main.py orchestrates instead of duplicating analytics
```

# Part 12 - Standard Git handoff

The Git workflow is already known.

Use the process defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

```text
feature branch
+
inspect diff
+
commit
+
push
+
Pull Request
+
review
+
merge
```

Suggested commit:

```text
feat: add reusable market comparison analytics
```

Suggested PR title:

```text
feat: add reusable market comparison analytics
```

The PR should include at least:

```text
src/analytics.py
src/main.py
```

Before TD08 begins, the reviewed TD07 analytics must be available from team `main`.

This is a dependency handoff, not another Git lesson.

# Checkpoint relation

Checkpoint B is performed after TD08.

TD07 prepares the comparison behaviour later visible in:

```text
04_instrument_benchmark.png
```

The canonical evidence contract is:

```text
docs/04_CHECKPOINTS_AND_EVIDENCE.md
```

Do not submit Checkpoint B yet.

# OPTIONAL

Complete optional work only after the CORE definition of done is satisfied.

## Optional 1 - Daily returns

Daily return compares a close with the previous close:

```text
(current close / previous close - 1) * 100
```

Possible function:

```python
def calculate_daily_returns(prices):
    returns = []

    for index in range(1, len(prices)):
        previous = prices[index - 1]
        current = prices[index]

        value = (
            current["close"] / previous["close"] - 1
        ) * 100

        returns.append({
            "date": current["date"],
            "ticker": current["ticker"],
            "return": value,
        })

    return returns
```

For 21 price observations:

```text
20 daily returns
```

This function is optional and later dashboard completion does not depend on it.

## Optional 2 - Best and worst daily return

Only if Optional 1 was completed:

```text
best daily return
worst daily return
```

Keep this outside required MarketPulse analytics.

## Optional 3 - Aligned comparison rows

Build a derived structure such as:

```python
{
    "date": "...",
    "instrument_close": ...,
    "benchmark_close": ...,
}
```

for common dates.

## Optional 4 - Small comparison table

Display a few base-100 rows:

```text
date        AAPL      SP500
2026-...   100.00    100.00
...
```

Do not turn the terminal output into a full dashboard.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

## TypeError during calculations

Inspect:

```python
print(type(row["close"]))
```

If `close` is still text, local CSV normalization was not applied.

## No common dates

Inspect:

```python
print(sorted(index_by_date(instrument_prices)))
print(sorted(index_by_date(benchmark_prices)))
```

Do not calculate performance on unrelated windows.

## Different aligned lengths

The two lists returned by `align_series()` must be built from the same `common_dates`.

## Base 100 does not start at 100

Verify:

```text
first close / first close * 100
=
100
```

## Relative-performance sign is wrong

Use:

```text
instrument return
-
benchmark return
```

## Import error for analytics

Verify:

```text
src/main.py
src/analytics.py
```

and run from the repository root:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

# Final readiness check

Each student should be able to explain:

```text
[ ] canonical row
[ ] numeric normalization
[ ] common-date alignment
[ ] period return
[ ] base 100
[ ] relative performance
[ ] percentage points
[ ] why analytics.py is provider-neutral
[ ] why provider identifiers do not belong in analytics.py
```

The team should confirm:

```text
[ ] src/analytics.py exists
[ ] TD07 analytics are merged before TD08
[ ] python src/main.py works
[ ] daily returns were not required
```

# What comes next?

TD08 introduces Yahoo Finance.

The dependency is now explicit:

```text
TD07
canonical numeric rows
+
align_series()
+
period return
+
base 100
+
relative performance
        |
        v
TD08
Yahoo provider
        |
        v
same analytics.py
```

The next test is architectural:

> Can Yahoo Finance feed the same comparison functions without changing the analytics layer?
